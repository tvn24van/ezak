## TODOs

- refactor data loading
- translations for ~~Polish~~, ~~english~~, ukrainian and maybe hungarian too?
- in desktop computers set title to *app name* - day, 21-02-2023 for e.g.
- maybe add updating desktop versions using https://pub.dev/packages/updat
- add keys shortcuts for switching currently displayed day, etc
- maybe someday home screen widgets to see schedule even without opening app thus
this is only possible with platform-specified code
