# **ezak**
- Unofficial app for viewing schedule for PANS in Nysa
- Nieoficjalna aplikacja do przeglÄ…dania planu PANS w Nysie

## TODOs

- refactor data loading
- translations for ~~Polish~~, ~~english~~, ukrainian and maybe hungarian too?
- in desktop computers set title to *app name* - day, 21-02-2023 for e.g.
- maybe add updating desktop versions using https://pub.dev/packages/updat
- add keys shortcuts for switching currently displayed day, etc
- maybe someday home screen widgets to see schedule even without opening app thus
this is only possible with platform-specified code

- release

## Generating code
- for translations `flutter gen-l10n` or run _gen_l10n.sh
- for classes `flutter pub run build_runner build`
- for icons `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`
